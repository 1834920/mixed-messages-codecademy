# Random Exercise Generator
Used to generate random excersices and so on...
## This project was meant to...

1. Generate a random body part to train at the gym 
2. Generate random excercises based on the 1st point.
3. Generate a random number of sets and reps while keeping both at a reasonable level

## How To Use
All you have to do is to click run and the code will do everything for you. Try it out in the gym and let me know if you like it. 
The reason i posted it here is to get some feedback to be able to learn faster.
so if there is anything you dont like (litterally anything) just let me know. 

### Disclaimer 
 * I know i spelled "exercise" wrong multiple times (honestly i dont care :) ).
 * I cant guaranty you will have a good time at the gym. 
 * If you have any feedback about anything let me know.
